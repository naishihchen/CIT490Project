                <h2>Bringing the Hope of Soap</h2>
                <p>At Soap Angels, we know that hygiene is incredibly important, and it can be very hard to stay clean when you're out of luck and out on the streets. That why, for every 100 soap products that are bought on SoapAngels.com, we'll donate 10 bars of soap to local homeless shelters.</p>
